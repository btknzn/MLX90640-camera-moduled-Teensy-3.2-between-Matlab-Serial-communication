# MLX90640-Termalcamera(IR KAMERA)-moduled-Teensy-3.2-between-Matlab-Serial-communication

This code is  for  SparkFun MLX90640 camera which is controlled by Tensy 3.2 and Matlab serial communcation. In this code Image taken from SparkFUN MLX90640 will send to Matlab and it used COM23 and 9600 boundrate and matlab receive this image in one matlab function.

You can easly use this codes to take image from MLX90640 and send to matlab for processing in one return type function like this,

Image1 = ArduinoserialImage()



IMPORTANT: IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU SHOULD USE COM23 FOR SERİAL PORT OTHERWİSE YOU SHOULD CHANGE IN MY CODE SERİAL PORT NAME AND ALSO IN MATLAB
.YOU CAN EASLY INCREASE THE SPEED OF CODE VİA INCREASING BOUNDCARE FOR COMMUNCATİON BUT 9600 FOR MY PROJECTS ENOUGH.
